# Ask Structured Questions

This optional command asks structured questions to de-risk ambiguous areas before planning.

## Purpose
Identify and clarify ambiguous or unclear requirements before creating the implementation plan.

## Instructions
When this command is invoked, you should:
1. Review the baseline specification
2. Identify areas that are ambiguous, unclear, or have missing information
3. Generate structured questions covering:
   - Functional requirements that need clarification
   - Technical decisions that need input
   - User experience details that are undefined
   - Edge cases that need definition
   - Integration points that need specification
   - Performance or scalability requirements
4. Organize questions by category or priority
5. Present questions in a clear, actionable format

## When to Use
Run this command before `/speckit.plan` if the specification has ambiguous areas that need clarification.

## Output
Generate a list of structured questions that need answers to proceed with confidence in the planning phase.
